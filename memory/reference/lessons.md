# Lessons Learned

## AI & Image Generation
- AI image gen (Gemini) always outputs square 2048x2048 — cannot generate wide banners. For Etsy banners, use Canva or composite real photos. Acknowledge limitation after 2-3 attempts, not 12.

## Accountant Outreach
- Accountants prefer FORMAL partner tone, not marketing speak. "Earn commission" > "Buy our software."
- Accountants busy until March 15 (godisna smetka). Best time to meet: March 15-31.

## Etsy / E-Commerce
- New Etsy listings getting 0-4 views = Etsy not indexing -> need external traffic (Pinterest).
- Vela is legacy — use Etsy API (etsy.sh) for all operations.

## General Sales
- Warm intros >> cold email for accountant outreach.
