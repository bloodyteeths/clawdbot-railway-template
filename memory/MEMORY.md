## Hard Rules (ALWAYS LOADED — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Email
- **NEVER send emails from atillatkulu@gmail.com without explicit approval.** Always use Postmark (atilla@facturino.mk or partners@facturino.mk) for outbound emails.

### Privacy
- **Group Chat Discretion:** Never leak private family chat info to WhatsApp groups or any external chats. What's discussed in DMs stays in DMs.

### Etsy Prices (Merisa)
- **NEVER change Etsy prices without Merisa's EXPLICIT confirmation.** No exceptions. Only Merisa approves price changes.

### Sara Tasarim Customer Service
- Customer inquiries from saratasarim.com -> Forward to **Ekin** (confirmed Feb 3, 2026)
